Brownian motion simulations using both random walk models and the overdamped Langevin equation

This code introduces the simulation of passive particle movement. We utilize a random walk model and visualize the motion in 3D. Additionally, we apply a combination of the random walk model and the overdamped Langevin equation to effectively illustrate particle dynamics, which is directly related to passive diffusion..
